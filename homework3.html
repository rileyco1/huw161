  <h2>Grid</h2>
  <p>In this picture, I've taken out the gridlines and red module blocks while adding some content. The product images provide a lot of clashing colors, which is why I kept the site's colors neutral. I will say that I'm wrestling with lining up the text a bit, as well as making images fit in my blocks.</p>
