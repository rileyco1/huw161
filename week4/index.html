<h1>Main Heading</h1>
<h3>H1 | Muli,800 | 36px</h3>
<br>

<h2>Secondary Heading</h2>
<h3>H2 | Muli,400 | 14px</h3>
<br>

<p>I chose Muli extra-bold 800 for my H1 font. This would be used for the banner/branding at the top of the page and would include the site's name, Aggregate Media Reviews. H2 consists of Muli regular 400 against the #555555 background color. This would be used for the aggregate review scores so that they stand out against the rest of the page. It would also be used in the navigation bar against a darker, #222222 background. Muli is a sans-serif font which makes it better suited for these headings. I also feel like the numbers in Muli match well with the numbers in Taviraj, the font I chose for the paragraph text. This text is also in the regular 400 font-weight, although there is one exception. In cases where I would need to italicize the name of a book or film, like <span class="italic">Slaughterhouse-Five</span> by Kurt Vonnegut, I've set up my CSS to switch to Taviraj 400i. Taviraj is a serif font. Both were found on Google Fonts.</p>
<p>EDIT: It looks like I still haven't figured out how to do the italics thing.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: I have italics now, but I'm not sure if they're in the proper weight.</p>
